4. Calculator (high delay costs shown)

**Timing:**

- User has invested 3-5 minutes (sunk cost)
- Results create urgency/concern
- Context is fresh

**Day 0: Immediate Delivery**
```
Subject: Your [PDF Name] is ready

Hey [Name],

Thanks for downloading [PDF Name]! Here it is:

[Download Button]

Quick question: Have you gotten any impact window
quotes yet?

If yes → Use our Quote Comparer tool to check for
red flags: [Link]

If no → Start with our Reality Check to see if
you're ready: [Link]

- The Window Guy Team
```

**Day 2: Tool Usage Push**
```
Subject: Found any red flags in your quotes?

[Name],

Just checking in - did you find the [PDF] helpful?

If you've gotten quotes, I highly recommend running
them through our Quote Comparer:

[CTA: Check My Quotes]

It only takes 2 minutes and helps you spot:
• Inflated pricing
• Permit scams
• Material quality issues
• Contract red flags

2,847 homeowners have used it. Average finding:
$3,800 in overcharges.

Worth a look?

- Pete
```

**Day 5: Vault Introduction**
```
Subject: Where are you keeping your quotes safe?

[Name],

Random question: Where do you keep your impact
window quotes, insurance docs, and home protection
paperwork?

Most people: Drawer, email, car, "somewhere" 😅

When hurricane season hits or you need to file a
claim, that stuff matters.

We built Horizons Vault specifically for this:

✓ Secure cloud storage for all your docs
✓ Hurricane season reminders & alerts
✓ Expert review of quotes (find overcharges)
✓ Insurance claim readiness tools

Try it free for 14 days: [CTA]

No credit card needed. Cancel anytime.

**Day 7: Social Proof**
```
Subject: How Sarah saved $6,200 using our tools

[Name],

Quick story:

Sarah from Boca got 2 impact window quotes:
• Contractor A: $28,450
• Contractor B: $22,200

She uploaded both to our system.

Our analysis found:
🚩 Contractor A was trying the "permit exemption"
   scam (would cost her $2K+ in fines)
🚩 Contractor A's labor was 30% above market
🚩 Both quotes had vague material specs

We connected her with a vetted contractor who beat
both quotes at $21,200.

Total savings: $7,250

Plus she avoided permit issues that would've been
a nightmare.

P.S. It's free for Vault members (14-day trial,
no credit card required)
```

**Day 14: Hurricane Urgency**
```
Subject: 47 days until hurricane season

[Name],

Hurricane season starts June 1st.

That's 47 days away.

If your windows fail during a storm:
• $50K-150K in water damage (average)
• 6-12 months dealing with insurance
• Possible mold remediation ($30K+)
• Displacement from your home

I don't mean to fear-monger, but I've seen it
happen to too many Florida homeowners.

Have you:
□ Decided on impact windows?
□ Gotten quotes?
□ Checked those quotes for red flags?
□ Made a decision?

If you're stuck on any of those, I can help:

Free consultation. No pressure.
