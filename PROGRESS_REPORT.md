## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **Architecture Decisions:**
1. ✅ **Stay with React:** No migration needed, focus on features
2. ✅ **Use Manus.ai for CRM:** 10x faster than manual coding
3. ✅ **Vercel over Lovable:** Better for collaboration when you hire devs
4. ✅ **Internal CRM + GHL:** You control data, contractor gets leads
5. ✅ **Facebook CAPI:** Bypasses ad blockers, better tracking

### **CRO Insights:**
1. ✅ **Value-first approach working:** Users complete tools before asking
2. ✅ **Strategic gating:** Upload triggers work better than upfront gates
3. ✅ **Missing conversions = massive revenue leak:** 1,800 leads/month lost
